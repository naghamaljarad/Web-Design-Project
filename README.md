- Welcome Back To Syria -

* my website project “Welcome back to Syria” contains 7 pages. Which were nicely formed using 7 html sheets, 3 style sheets (CSS), 1 JavaScript and 1 php.
* In this website, I wanted to share some of my favourite memories in my homeland Syria, so I made up a website that would give the user a tour in Syria to visit few of her counties and the capital of Syria Damascus, provided with videos and photos  and some facts about each city.

* The main Features about the website:
  •	HOME: which includes the title, the buttons for few counties on the side, a navigation bar, a search bar for any information the user needs, beside a YouTube video for the   user to get an idea of Syria’s beauty before the war.
  •	Historical visit: JavaScript was used to create the slideshow in the “Historical visit” page to show few of the historical pictures of palmyra, and that was done using       jssor.slider.min JavaScript. 
  
  •	Contact Us, Restaurants, Damascus and Aleppo: display some information and paragraphs about each one of them provided with photos and videos to demonstrate what is  described (mainly html and CSS).
•	Donation: PHP is used within the “Donation” page, as the donor’s name, phone number and emails are saved in a file that is created the second submit button is hit. Beside the message that is alerted when the donation is completed.
